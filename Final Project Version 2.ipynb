    "Throughout this project, we tested our data science question by splitting it up into three smaller questions. In our first analysis, we followed the trend of shot distances for 2P, midrange, and 3P shots over time. In our second analysis, we looked at the relationships between both the percentages and the raw number of three-pointers when compared to the amount of three-pointers attempted, made, and all shots attempted. In our last analysis, we compared the average shot distance for the winning team of each season over the past two decades."

    "One of the most popular sports in the United States is basketball. Within the game of basketball, the three-point shot has increased in popularity and has greatly impacted the game ever since the introduction of the three-point line. Many basketball players today have the three-point shot as part of their skillset and it is an important skill to have for guards. Even centers today, who traditionally are not known for shooting, are beginning to pick up the three-point shot. Additionally, college athletes today are shooting more three-point shots than ever before. However, the three-point line is a relatively new creation as it was added to basketball in 1979 while basketball was first invented in 1891 and the National Basketball Association (NBA) created in 1946. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at previous projects, students have looked into the impact of the three-point shot and also the practicality or effectiveness of the three-point shot. But, none have explored and analyzed the change in shot distance because of the three-point line. We believe that the amount of shots taken at longer distances have increased ever since the introduction of the three-point line, especially as teams place more and more weight on three-point shots in their game plans.\n",

    "## Hypothesis:\n",
    "The average NBA shot distance will have increased due to the addition of the three-point line. With the introduction of the three-point line, as players become better shooters and more familiar with the three-point line, players will take their shots from a farther distance to have a chance at making three-point shots, as statistically, a three-point shot contributes more to a game victory than a two-point shot. Additionally, the average NBA shot distance is directly proportional to the distance of the three-point line from the hoop, so as more players begin to take more and more three-point shots, and the three-point line gets pushed further out, the average shot distance of the NBA will consequently increase.

    "https://www.basketball-reference.com/ will be our primary resource to gather data from. It has nearly everything one would want regarding basketball statistics from statistics for current and past players, teams, and coaches, meaning we are able to collect concise empirical data for absolutely any and all specific data points we would want to extrapolate from just this one resource. This website also allows us to export data through CSV files, which we can easily import into Python. This also means that data wrangling on the datasets coming from this website should be very simple and straightforward.\n",

    "One ethical consideration we can consider is that the data should be blinded. What that means is that the data should be based purely off of what we are analyzing, which in our proposed experiment is the shot distance, rather than taking into consideration inconsequential factors such as race, height, and weight. Other than that, we cannot foresee any other big ethical roadblocks, as the analysis is simply made on observed data that would otherwise occur whether our analysis happens or not (i.e we are not instigating events in order for us to get data points)."

    "## Conclusion & Discussion\n",
    "   After analyzing all our data and graphs, we found that the average NBA shot distance has changed over time, specifically the number of attempts of three-pointers have increased tremendously. From our first analysis where this question was broken down specifically to shots made, we found that the percentage of 3P shots made has not significantly increased. We cleaned the data set and plotted the percentages for each type of shot for each season versus time. We used a linear model to fit our data and eventually merged all three graphs into one graph to show the relationship between the percentage of 2P, midrange, and 3P shots made. P-tests were used to analyze the trend of shots made over time; we even found a significant increase in the percentage of 2P and midrange shots made. The conclusion from this portion of our data analysis strikes us as surprising since the number of 3P attempts has significantly increased over the years.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   In our second analysis, we discovered several relationships between the percentages and raw amount of shots taken. From our analysis, we once again found that the percentage of three-pointers made versus three-pointers attempted stayed relatively the same. This simply just means there wasn’t a sudden increase in ability to make three-pointers. However, we did find a dramatic increase in the percentage of three-pointers attempted vs. all shots attempted. Looking at the percentage in 2000, and the percentage in 2019, we can that the percentage of three-pointers attempted nearly doubled across this span of time. It is important to note that this is the percentage, and not raw numbers, as in general we can see the number of three-point shots increased, but this uptrend persists even when looking at ratios. This means the increase is not confounded with the fact that the number of shots attempted simply increased over time, but that there is actually a significant increase in the percentage of three-pointers attempted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in our third analysis... \n",
    "Some limitations of our analysis are that our data has only come from the past two decades, whereas the NBA three-point line has existed for forty years, and the data from the NBA season of 2011-2012 had to be dropped because only 66 games were played instead of 82 games. \n"
